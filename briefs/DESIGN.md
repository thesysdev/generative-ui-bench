# Brief design

The 46 screen briefs in `briefs.ts`, and the rules they were written under.
This file is the design record; the briefs themselves are frozen. Changing a
brief invalidates every raw generated against it, so any change means new raw
dirs and a full rerun.

## What the briefs measure

Failure rate versus screen complexity, where complexity is the number of
numbered requirements in the brief, known by construction. The model keeps
full structural freedom: requirements name content and intent, never
components or layout, so every mistake class stays live (wrong component
choice, bad props, broken references, hallucinated names).

## Prompt template (frozen)

Each scenario becomes this user message (system prompts are the official per-format
generators, untouched):

```
{context} Build a single screen for this. It must show:
1. {requirement}
...
N. {requirement}
Cover every numbered item.
```

Requirement count N is the scenario's complexity value. Bands:

| band | requirements | scenarios | label |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | 2–3 | 10 | glance |
| B2 | 4–6 | 10 | simple screen |
| B3 | 7–10 | 10 | working screen |
| B4 | 11–15 | 8 | dense screen |
| B5 | 16–20 | 8 | full workspace |

## Scenario authoring rules (enforced before sign-off)

1. Requirements name **content and intent only**. Never a component, never layout.
2. Banned (word-boundary, case-insensitive grep over this file's scenario section
   must return zero hits): every catalog component name plus common UI/layout nouns:
   `accordion, areachart, barchart, button, callout, card, chart, checkbox, chip,
   chips, col, datepicker, form, grid, header, icon, image, inline, input, list,
   metric, modal, option, picker, radio, row, column, scatter, section, segmented,
   select, slider, snippet, stack, stacked, steps, switch, tab, tabs, table, tag,
   text, textarea, toggle, side-by-side, dropdown, badge`.
3. Every requirement must be expressible with the 70-component catalog (reviewed by
   hand once at sign-off).
4. Interactive intents phrased as "a way to ..." so the model chooses the control.
