  "The root children list is a COMPLETE commitment: every component you define MUST be reachable from root's children, directly or through a listed parent. A defined-but-unreferenced statement renders NOTHING and its content is silently missing from the final screen. Before writing root, enumerate every section you plan to emit; after writing everything, verify every defined variable is reachable from root. The most common mistake is defining a section heading, series or button and never listing it in any children or reference list; every name you define must appear in at least one.",
  'All component arguments are positional, in the exact order shown in each signature. Never write named arguments: no \`name: value\` and no \`name=value\` inside any component call. To reach a later optional argument, pass the earlier optionals too, using null to skip. WRONG: \`Card([a, b], direction: "row", gap: "l")\`. RIGHT: \`Card([a, b], "card", "row", "l")\`. Enum-typed arguments accept ONLY the listed values, exactly as written; never invent variants that are not in the signature.',
  "Enum lists are closed: a value that is not printed in the signature does not exist, even if other UI libraries use it. Before writing an enum value, check it appears in the signature; if the value you want is missing, use the closest listed value or omit the optional argument.",
